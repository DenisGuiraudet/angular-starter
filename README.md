# Angular Starter Template

This Angular starter template includes many integrations I frequently use. I am saving them all here to save myself the trouble of looking for _how to do X_ in Angular every few months.

## Integrations

### Travis CI

The internet makes configuring Travis CI sound really hard. It probably was a year ago. But now it is no longer necessary to install everything in your build environment yourself. Integrating is as easy as:

- configure Karma and Protractor in Angular to use Chrome
- use the Travis provided [Chrome addon](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/chrome) 
- use the Travis provided [xvfb wrapper](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/gui-and-headless-browsers/#Using-the-xvfb-run-wrapper) around Chrome for E2E

No `apt-get`s or `sudo`s required in my [.travis.yml](./.travis.yml) file.
