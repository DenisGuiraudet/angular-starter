This Angular starter template includes many integrations I frequently use. I am saving them all here to save myself the trouble of looking for _how to do X_ in Angular every few months.

## Generated by Angular CLI

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.7.1.

```
ng new angular-starter --style css --routing true
```
